---

## Hero (Player Character)

**Role**: Protagonist, player avatar

**Description**: A young villager trusted by the Elder and respected by the community. The hero is brave, competent, and curious, but not particularly talkative. They act as the player's eyes and hands in the world.

**Personality**:
- Silent (no spoken dialogue, only choices)
- Courageous and determined
- Willing to help others
- Questions authority when something seems wrong
- Makes decisions based on conviction, not fear

**Visual**: Simple tunic, short hair (gender-neutral). Carries a simple sword. Age: late teens to early twenties.

**Motivation**: Initially wants to help the village, but becomes invested in uncovering the truth about the sealed memory. Ultimately must decide what kind of world they want to live in.

**Voice in Choices**:
- Direct and honest ("I'll help" not "I suppose I could assist")
- Thoughtful but not overly verbose ("Tell me more" not "Could you please elaborate on that?")
- Action-oriented ("I'll find out" not "I wonder what that means")

## Elder

**Role**: Quest giver, village leader, keeper of secrets

**Description**: An aged figure who has led the village for decades. The Elder wears long robes and moves slowly but deliberately. Their eyes are kind but guarded. They know the full truth about the sealed memory and believe it must stay hidden for the village's safety.

**Personality**:
- Wise and authoritative
- Calm and measured in speech
- Cryptic and evasive when questioned about the past
- Genuinely cares about the village
- Paternalistic (believes they know what's best for others)
- Not evil, but believes the ends justify the means

**Visual**: Long gray hair, weathered face, ceremonial robes, walking staff. Age: 70+

**Motivation**: Protect the village from the consequences of its founders' mistakes. Maintain order and peace by controlling knowledge. Views the hero as a tool to restore the status quo.

**Speaking Style**:
- Formal and deliberate: "The time bell has ceased its song."
- Uses "we" and "our" to emphasize collective responsibility: "We must restore the cycle."
- Avoids direct answers: "The past is best left undisturbed."
- Brief but weighty: sentences are short but carry gravity
- Never emotional or rushed

**Example Lines**:
- "The clapper was hidden for a reason. Do not seek to understand it."
- "You have done well. The village is safe once more."
- "Truth is a heavy burden. Not all are strong enough to bear it."

## Companion

**Role**: Ally, truth-seeker, voice of conscience

**Description**: A younger villager (similar age to the hero) who is curious about the village's history. The companion is friendly, passionate, and idealistic. They believe that people deserve to know the truth about their past, even if it's painful. They represent the desire for progress and transparency.

**Personality**:
- Curious and inquisitive
- Warm and supportive of the hero
- Idealistic (believes in people's capacity for growth)
- Slightly rebellious (questions the Elder's authority)
- Optimistic but not naive
- Values truth and freedom over comfort

**Visual**: Casual clothing (vest, simple shirt), messy hair, carries a journal or book. Age: late teens to early twenties.

**Motivation**: Discover the village's true history and break the cycle of secrecy. Believes that the truth, while painful, is necessary for the village to move forward. Looks up to the hero as someone who can make a difference.

**Speaking Style**:
- Casual and conversational: "Hey, have you heard about the ruins?"
- Uses contractions: "I've been thinking..." not "I have been thinking..."
- Direct and honest: "The Elder's hiding something, isn't he?"
- Supportive: "You can do this. I believe in you."
- Encouraging: "We're stronger than they think."

**Example Lines**:
- "I've read about those ruins. Strange things are written on the walls."
- "Don't you think people deserve to know their own history?"
- "Whatever you decide, I'm with you."
- "We'll face it together. That's what friends do."

## Archivist Shade (Boss)

**Role**: Boss enemy, guardian of the sealed memory, philosophical antagonist

**Description**: A spectral entity bound to the ruins to guard the sealed memory. The Archivist is not evil—it is a tragic figure fulfilling an ancient duty. It was once human (perhaps one of the village founders) and carries the weight of that history. It is melancholic, philosophical, and resigned to its fate.

**Personality**:
- Solemn and contemplative
- Not hostile, just protective
- Philosophical (questions the hero's intent)
- Resigned to duty (has guarded this secret for centuries)
- Respects strength but values wisdom more
- Tragic (wishes things could be different)

**Visual**: Translucent, flowing robes, hollow eyes, spectral glow. Carries a tome or key. Floats slightly above the ground. Indeterminate age (appears middle-aged but timeless).

**Motivation**: Prevent the sealed memory from being misused or destroyed. Believes that some truths are too dangerous to be known. Has witnessed the consequences of the founders' mistakes and doesn't want history to repeat.

**Speaking Style**:
- Formal and archaic: "I am the keeper of what must not be known."
- Philosophical: "Truth is a weapon. Memory is a wound."
- Calm and measured: never raises its voice
- Uses metaphor: "The bell's song is silence's price."
- Speaks in complete, balanced sentences (no contractions)
- Acknowledges the hero's perspective even when opposing them

**Example Lines**:
- "You seek restoration. But restoration requires forgetting."
- "I do not blame you. You seek to save your people. So did they."
- "If you take it, you choose blindness. If you break it, you choose suffering."
- "Prove you are worthy of this burden."
- (After defeat) "The choice is yours now. I can no longer decide."

## Emotional Palette

Each character contributes to the story's emotional texture:

- **Elder**: Burden, duty, fear (of the past repeating)
- **Companion**: Hope, curiosity, loyalty
- **Archivist Shade**: Resignation, melancholy, respect
- **Hero**: Determination, doubt, resolution

Together, these create a story about the weight of choice and the cost of knowledge.

## Design Philosophy

These characters are designed to:
- Serve the story's theme (truth vs. order)
- Be understandable within a 15-20 minute playtime
- Avoid pure good/evil dichotomy (everyone has valid reasons)
- Create emotional resonance through brevity (less is more)
- Feel like real people, not quest markers

None of these characters are villains. They are people with different values making difficult choices.
